(Display three cards) Write a program that displays three cards randomly
selected from a deck of 52, as shown in Figure 14.43c. The card image files are
named 1.png, 2.png, . . . , 52.png and stored in the image/card directory. All
three cards are distinct and selected randomly. (Hint: You can select random
cards by storing the numbers 1â€“52 to an array list, perform a random shuffle
introduced in Section 11.12, and use the first three numbers in the array list as
the file names for the i
 */

/*
APPROACH:
A --> create a card class and access card attributes
    1 --> create card class
        a. make image field
        b. associate image field with cardImage directory
        c. make getter method

    2 --> make image accessible through cards
    3 --> randomly access 3 given cards and use getImage()
B --> directly access an array of images
    1 --> create directory with images
    2 --> create accessible array with images
    3 --> facilitate access to directory images
    4 --> randomly present 3 images in directory
