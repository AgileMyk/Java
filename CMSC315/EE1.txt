A high tension current is capable of forcing its way against considerable resistance, whereas, a low
tension current must have its path made easy.

Production of the Electric Current.—To produce a steady flow of water in a pipe two conditions are necessary.
There must first be available a hydraulic pressure, or, as it is technically called, a “head” of water produced
by a pump, or a difference of level or otherwise.

In addition to the pressure there must also be a suitable path or channel provided for the water to flow through,
or there will be no flow, however great the “head,” until something breaks down under the strain. In the case just
cited, although there is full pressure in the water in the pipe, there is no current of water as long as the tap
remains closed. The opening of the tap completes the necessary path (the greater part of which was already in
existence) and the water flows.


Fig. 36.—Hydraulic analogy of the electric current. If, say 10 gallons of water flow in every second into a system
 of vessels and pipes of any shape, whether simple or more complicated as shown in the figure, and 10 gallons flow
 out again per second, it is evident that through every cross section of any vessel or pipe of the system 10 gallons
 of water pass every second. This follows from the fact that water is an uncompressible liquid and must be practically
 of the same density throughout the system. The water moves slowly where the section is large and quickly where it
 is small, and thus the quantity of water that flows through any part of the system is independent of the cross
 section of that part. The same condition holds good for the electric current; if in a closed circuit a constant
 current circulates, the same amount of electricity will pass every cross section per second. Hence the following
 law: The magnitude of a constant current in any circuit is equal in all parts of the circuit.
For the production of a steady electric current two very similar conditions are necessary. There must be a steadily
maintained electric pressure, known under different aspects as “electromotive force,” “potential difference,” or
“voltage.” This alone, however, is not sufficient. In addition, a suitable conducting path is necessary. Any break
in this path occupied by unsuitable material acts like the closed tap in the analogous case above mentioned, and
it is only when all such breaks have been properly bridged by suitable material, that is, by conductors, that the
effects which denote the flow of the current will begin to be manifested.

The necessary electromotive force or voltage required to cause the current to flow may be obtained:

1. Chemically;
2. Mechanically;
3. Thermally.
In the first method, two dissimilar metals such as copper and zinc called elements, are immersed in an exciting
fluid or electrolyte.

Series connection of a line of glass vessels.
Fig. 37.—Volta’s “Crown of Cups.” The metallic elements C and Z each consisted of two metals, the plate C being of
copper and the plate Z of zinc. They were placed, as shown, in the glass vessels, which contained salt water and
ordinary water or lye. Into each vessel, except the two end ones, the copper end of one arc and the zinc end of the
next were introduced, the series, however long, ending with copper dipping into the terminal vessel at one end and
zinc into that at the other. The arrangement is almost exactly that of a modern one-fluid primary battery.
When the elements are connected at their terminals by a wire or conductor a chemical action takes place, producing
a current which flows from the copper to the zinc. This device is called a cell, and the combination of two or more of them connected so as to form a unit is known as a battery. The word battery is frequently used incorrectly for a single cell. That terminal of the element from which the current flows is called the plus or positive pole, and the terminal of the other element the negative pole.

Cells are said to be primary or secondary according as they generate a current of themselves, or first require to be charged from an external source, storing up a current supply which is afterwards yielded in the reverse direction to that of the charging current.

An electric current is generated mechanically by a dynamo. In either case no electricity is produced, but part of the supply already existing is simply set in motion by creating an electric pressure.

An electric current, according to the third method, is generated directly from heat energy, as will be later explained; the current thus obtained is very feeble.
