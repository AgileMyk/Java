/*
(NumberFormatException) Listing 7.9, Calculator.java, is a simple commandline calculator. Note that the program terminates if any
operand is nonnumeric.
Write a program with an exception handler that deals with nonnumeric operands;
then write another program without using an exception handler to achieve the
same objective. Your program should display a message that informs the user of
the wrong operand type before exiting (see Figure 12.12).
