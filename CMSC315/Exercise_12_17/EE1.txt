A high tension current is capable of forcing its way against considerable resistance, whereas, a low
tension current must have its path made easy.

Production of the Electric Current.—To produce a steady flow of water in a pipe two conditions are necessary.
There must first be available a hydraulic pressure, or, as it is technically called, a “head” of water produced
by a pump, or a difference of level or otherwise.

An electric current, according to the third method, is generated directly from heat energy, as will be later explained; the current thus obtained is very feeble.
