(Game: ATM machine) Use the Account class created in Programming Exercise 9.7 to simulate an ATM machine.
Create ten accounts in an array with id
0, 1, . . . , 9, and initial balance $100. The system prompts the user to enter an
id. If the id is entered incorrectly, ask the user to enter a correct id. Once an id
is accepted, the main menu is displayed as shown in the sample run. You can
enter a choice 1 for viewing the current balance, 2 for withdrawing money, 3 for
depositing money, and 4 for exiting the main menu. Once you exit, the system
will prompt for an id again. Thus, once the system starts, it will not stop.

9.7 (The Account class) Design a class named Account that contains:
 ■ A private int data field named id for the account (default 0).
 ■ A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0).
 ■ A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate (default 0). Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.
 ■ A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the
account was created.
 ■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default account.
 ■ A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance.
 ■ The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance, and annualInterestRate.
 ■ The accessor method for dateCreated.
 ■ A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly
interest rate.
 ■ A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
 ■ A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the
account.
 ■ A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account
